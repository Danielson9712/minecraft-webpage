        <p>
            During the summer we played a lot of Minecraft and put in some hours into that game. We planned on taking Sys Admin together and when we were given
            the oppurtunity to create any service we wanted to we immediately decided to create a Minecraft Server. After the class is over we plan on expanding this
            to include more mods and features. Our goal is to have a server for us and our friends to play on.
